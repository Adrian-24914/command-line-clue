## Notes

The location was the study in the library inside the mansion - the room must have been empty when it happened...
Clue in the garden... should go to the bakery in the shops
In the bakery I found a clue to go to the study, but I found steps to the garden in my way throught the mansion. 
I found the Banker inside the greenhouse
I think I might have solved the mistery, I found a brass clandestick...
I finally Understood the game, I never saw de Journalist in any of the rooms, neither the paint brush. 
I saw everything but that person and that object.
